üî¨ Research Background
Problem Statement
Traditional RAG systems suffer from:

Topic Fragmentation: Fixed-window chunking breaks discourse boundaries

Static Parameters: No adaptation to content diversity or performance feedback

Domain Blindness: One-size-fits-all approach across heterogeneous documents

Evaluation Gaps: Component-level metrics don't reflect end-to-end quality

Our Solution
AURORA-RAG addresses these challenges through:

Coherence-Preserving Segmentation: Two-tier clustering preserves semantic boundaries

Online Parameter Control: Actor-critic optimization maximizes utility reward

Domain Adaptation: Specialized processing policies for different content types

End-to-End Evaluation: Black-box harness with multimodal reliability metrics

Mathematical Foundation
Coherence Rule: cos(Es_j, centroid(E_C)) ‚â• Œ¥

Utility Reward: r = w‚ÇÅF‚ÇÅ + w‚ÇÇCoherence + w‚ÇÉLatency + w‚ÇÑError

Where:

Es_j: Sentence embedding

E_C: Current chunk centroid

Œ¥: Domain-specific threshold

w_i: Learned weights
