Smart Document Reader: A RAG-Based QA Assistant Using LLaMA and FAISS
📌 Project Overview

Smart Document Reader is an AI-powered Question Answering (QA) assistant that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Meta’s LLaMA 3.2 model and FAISS vector search to provide accurate, document-grounded responses. Unlike generic chatbots such as ChatGPT, this system retrieves relevant information directly from user-uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.), ensuring context-aware, reliable, and privacy-focused answers.

This project is developed as part of a Final Year B.Tech (CSE) Minor Project, aiming to demonstrate how open-source LLMs + retrieval systems can power domain-specific, real-world applications.

🚀 Key Features

📂 Multi-format document support (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)

🔍 Efficient semantic search using FAISS embeddings

🧠 RAG pipeline to combine document retrieval with generative reasoning

🔒 Offline & privacy-preserving (no external API calls required)

⚡ Fast inference powered by LLaMA 3.2 (open-source)

🎯 Domain-aware responses tailored to the uploaded content

🖥️ Interactive UI (Streamlit-based interface)

🔧 Extensible architecture for adding speech, multi-doc search, or cloud integration

🛠️ Tech Stack

LLM: Meta LLaMA 3.2

Retrieval: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

Frameworks: LangChain, Hugging Face

UI/Frontend: Streamlit

Document Processing: PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, python-docx

Optional Extensions: Whisper (speech-to-text), Weaviate/Milvus (future vector DB support)

📂 System Workflow

Upload Document → (PDF/DOCX/TXT)

Preprocessing → Chunking + Embedding generation (BAAI / Hugging Face embeddings)

Indexing → Store embeddings in FAISS for semantic similarity search

User Query → Natural language question input

Retrieval → FAISS fetches top-k relevant document chunks

Answer Generation → LLaMA 3.2 generates a contextual response

Result Display → Streamlit UI shows the final answer + supporting document text

🔮 Future Scope

📊 Multi-document querying (search across multiple uploads)

🎙️ Speech-enabled interaction (Whisper + TTS integration)

☁️ Hybrid deployment (local + cloud) for scalability

📑 Research publication based on performance & benchmarking

🎓 Integration with college website for academic assistance

🔐 Domain-specific fine-tuning (e.g., law, healthcare, education)
